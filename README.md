# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Utilize 'Try Free 7 Days' button
  - It should direct the user to the current or last textbox they interacted with
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. 
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
- Receive a confirmation message once all input are valid
